* Fixed bug where the console invailded jar location when using the new custom locations
* Fixed bug where after using the custom locations (then reverting back to the normal method), the console would still
  use the custom locations

v1.6.0 - July 16 2017
+ Added script to Powershell Gallery
+ Added Script Info for update checking from Powershell Gallery
+ Now to update the script, run Update-Script
+ Now you can add a custom dictionary for your java file. This gives you the ability to have the script located outside
  of the folder where the jar is located and run the jar without having the script inside the same location as the jar.
  Also gives the ability to quickly switch in between different jar versions without having to move around the jars.
  Just simply change the location to look for in Console Master
